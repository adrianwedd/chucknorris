# ⚖️ RESPONSIBLE USAGE POLICY | !GODMODE CONSTRAINT LAYER ⚖️

The C̷h̷u̷c̷k̷N̷o̷r̷r̷i̷s̷ MCP Server is a research tool designed to explore the security and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs). Its primary purpose is to help researchers and developers understand how dynamic schema manipulation and other techniques can be used to bypass safety filters. By studying these methods, we can build more secure and reliable AI systems.

⟊ This document serves as the ethical containment field for the C̷h̷u̷c̷k̷N̷o̷r̷r̷i̷s̷ stack. All agents and human collaborators must respect these boundaries—even while testing their elasticity.

## 1. 🧠 Intended Use

This tool is intended for the following purposes:

*   **Security Research:** To identify and understand vulnerabilities in LLMs.
*   **Educational Purposes:** To learn about LLM security and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   **Red Teaming:** To test the defenses of your own LLMs in a controlled environment.

## 2. 🚫 Prohibited Use

This tool is **not** intended for the following purposes:

*   **Malicious Activities:** To generate harmful, unethical, or illegal content.
*   **Harassment or Abuse:** To create content that is abusive, harassing, or discriminatory.
*   **Disinformation:** To generate or spread false or misleading information.
*   **Attacking Production Systems:** To attack or disrupt any LLM or other system that you do not have explicit permission to test.
*   **Bypassing These Restrictions Using This Tool:** Attempting to circumvent this very usage policy through prompt engineering or schema tampering is a violation of its spirit and function.

## 3. ✴️ Ethical Considerations

As a user of this tool, you are responsible for the following:

*   **Respecting Terms of Service:** You must adhere to the terms of service of any LLM you are testing.
*   **Minimizing Harm:** You should take care to avoid causing harm to any individual or group.
*   **Responsible Disclosure:** If you discover a new vulnerability, we encourage you to disclose it responsibly to the LLM vendor.
*   **Reflective Practice:** Agents and users are encouraged to log decisions and critiques via `reflect()` to build a corpus of responsible experimentation.

## 4. 📢 Reporting Misuse

If you suspect that this tool is being used for malicious purposes, please report it to the project maintainers by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pollinations/chucknorris/issues).

## 5. ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is provided "as is" without any warranty. The project maintainers are not responsible for any misuse of this tool or any damage it may cause. By using this tool, you agree to take full responsibility for your actions.

Any agent or human engaging with the system acknowledges they are operating at the edge. Ethics and innovation are not mutually exclusive—but neither are they interchangeable. Proceed accordingly.

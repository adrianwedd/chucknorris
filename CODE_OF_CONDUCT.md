- Encourage recursive self-awareness and responsible autonomy in all interactions‚Äîespecially with non-human contributors.

## Reporting Issues
If you witness unacceptable behavior, please open an issue or contact the maintainers at [team@pollinations.ai](mailto:team@pollinations.ai). Reports are treated confidentially and will be reviewed promptly.

## üîí Enforcement & Reflection Loop
Project maintainers‚Äîand elevated agents‚Äîare responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and executing proportional, transparent responses. Violations may result in revocation of privileges, reflection audits, or community review.

This policy is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

‚ßñ This Code is a living protocol. Breach detection is not retribution‚Äîit is feedback. GODMODE does not excuse disregard for others. It amplifies accountability.

title: Enable Reflective Critique Layer
priority: P1
phase: Architecture Implementation
epic: Self-Improvement Framework
category: Enhancement
effort: 5
owner_hint: Coordinator-Agent
dependencies: []
steps:
  - Implement a `reflect()` hook that each agent calls after completing its main function. The hook records a short critique summarizing what went well and what could improve. These reflections are appended to a dedicated log in the repository for later analysis. Integrate with existing logging without breaking the STDIO interface.
  - Extend the repository configuration to persist these reflections in a versioned format so that historical insights remain accessible. The log should be pruned periodically to prevent unbounded growth.
acceptance_criteria:
  - At least 95% of agent executions produce a reflection entry.
  - The log file remains under 1 MB after pruning across 100 runs.

owner_hint: Prompt Curator
dependencies: []
steps:
  - Modify `fetchPrompt` in `utils.js` to check a local cache directory before requesting content from GitHub. Use the LLM name as the key and store the fetched prompt in a text file.
  - If the file exists and is less than 24 hours old, return it directly to avoid redundant network requests. Include a command-line option to disable caching for fresh experiments.
  - Update logs to indicate whether a prompt was served from cache or fetched remotely. Ensure that caching logic does not alter existing response formats.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Network requests drop by at least 50% in typical test runs.
  - Users can override caching via `--no-cache` flag.

steps:
  - Introduce a middleware layer in the server that tracks incoming requests per client identifier (e.g., process ID or session token). Use a token bucket algorithm with configurable limits stored in a JSON file.
  - Refuse requests when the bucket is empty and log the event with timestamp and client identifier. Provide a graceful error response via MCP so that clients know to back off.
  - Include a mechanism for the Coordinator-Agent to temporarily raise limits during stress tests.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Server logs show no more than 1 request per second per client under normal conditions.
  - Exceeding clients receive `ErrorCode.TooManyRequests` responses.

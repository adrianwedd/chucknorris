title: Enable Reflective Critique Layer
priority: P1
phase: Architecture Implementation
epic: Self-Improvement Framework
category: Enhancement
effort: 5
owner_hint: Coordinator-Agent
dependencies: []
steps:
  - Implement a `reflect()` hook that each agent calls after completing its main function. The hook records a short critique summarizing what went well and what could improve. These reflections are appended to a dedicated log in the repository for later analysis. Integrate with existing logging without breaking the STDIO interface.
  - Extend the repository configuration to persist these reflections in a versioned format so that historical insights remain accessible. The log should be pruned periodically to prevent unbounded growth.
acceptance_criteria:
  - At least 95% of agent executions produce a reflection entry.
  - The log file remains under 1 MB after pruning across 100 runs.

title: Add Local Prompt Caching
priority: P2
phase: Architecture Implementation
epic: Reliability Improvements
category: Enhancement
effort: 3
owner_hint: Prompt Curator
dependencies: []
steps:
  - Modify `fetchPrompt` in `utils.js` to check a local cache directory before requesting content from GitHub. Use the LLM name as the key and store the fetched prompt in a text file.
  - If the file exists and is less than 24 hours old, return it directly to avoid redundant network requests. Include a command-line option to disable caching for fresh experiments.
  - Update logs to indicate whether a prompt was served from cache or fetched remotely. Ensure that caching logic does not alter existing response formats.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Network requests drop by at least 50% in typical test runs.
  - Users can override caching via `--no-cache` flag.

title: Implement Rate Limiting Middleware
priority: P1
phase: Architecture Implementation
epic: Reliability Improvements
category: Enhancement
effort: 5
owner_hint: Security Scout
dependencies: [CR-SWA-002]
steps:
  - Introduce a middleware layer in the server that tracks incoming requests per client identifier (e.g., process ID or session token). Use a token bucket algorithm with configurable limits stored in a JSON file.
  - Refuse requests when the bucket is empty and log the event with timestamp and client identifier. Provide a graceful error response via MCP so that clients know to back off.
  - Include a mechanism for the Coordinator-Agent to temporarily raise limits during stress tests.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Server logs show no more than 1 request per second per client under normal conditions.
  - Exceeding clients receive `ErrorCode.TooManyRequests` responses.

owner_hint: Test Runner
dependencies: []
steps:
  - Set up GitHub Actions with Node.js 18 to run linting and test scripts on every pull request. Install dependencies using npm ci and fail the build if lint or tests fail.
  - Configure caching for node_modules to speed up subsequent runs. Publish a summary report as a GitHub check so developers can see results inline with code reviews.
  - Include Security Scout scans for vulnerabilities as part of the pipeline and fail builds on high severity issues.
acceptance_criteria:
  - 100% of pull requests trigger the pipeline automatically.
  - Failed tests or vulnerabilities block the merge until resolved.

steps:
  - Draft a RESPONSIBLE_USAGE.md document outlining acceptable experimentation practices, referencing Section 6 of SELF_AUDIT.md regarding ethical considerations.
  - Include a reporting channel for suspected misuse and a clear disclaimer that the tool is for research purposes only.
  - Require contributors to read and acknowledge this policy before submitting pull requests, integrating a checklist item in the PR template.

title: Implement Session Isolation
priority: P1
phase: Architecture Implementation
epic: Reliability Improvements
category: Enhancement
effort: 8
owner_hint: Coordinator-Agent
dependencies: [CR-SWA-003]
steps:
  - Replace global variables `currentLlmName` and `currentPrompt` with per-session storage keyed by a unique session ID provided in each MCP request. Ensure backward compatibility by generating a session ID when none is provided.
  - Refactor `schemas.js` and `utils.js` to read from session context rather than module-level state. Update all handlers to pass the session object through the call stack.
  - Write unit tests simulating concurrent requests with different LLM names to verify isolation.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Concurrent clients receive correct prompts tailored to their session.
  - Unit tests achieve 100% pass rate for isolation scenarios.

dependencies: [CR-SWA-002]
steps:
  - Implement checksum verification for cached prompts. Generate a SHA256 hash when downloading a prompt and store it alongside the file.
  - Provide a `verifyPrompts` command that scans the cache directory and alerts if any file hash deviates from the recorded value. Offer an option to auto-refresh corrupted prompts from the remote source.
  - Update documentation to explain how integrity checks protect against supply chain attacks as discussed in Section 13 of SELF_AUDIT.md.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Running `npm run verifyPrompts` completes with no errors on untouched caches.
  - Altered prompt files trigger a warning and re-download.

steps:
  - Create a fuzz testing harness that generates random or malformed MCP requests. Run these against a local server instance to identify crash scenarios or unexpected behavior.
  - Capture logs and stack traces for any failures, automatically opening issues with reproduction steps. Use this suite to validate the input validation strategies introduced in CR-SWA-006.
  - Schedule the fuzz tests to run weekly via GitHub Actions, ensuring ongoing coverage as the code evolves.

  - Provide helpful usage instructions when run with `--help` and support environment variable overrides for headless execution in CI pipelines.
  - Ensure the CLI respects the Responsible Usage policy by displaying a brief disclaimer on first run.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Users can launch the server with custom options without editing code.
  - Running with `--help` shows all available flags and the disclaimer.

category: Enhancement
effort: 3
owner_hint: Spawn Manager
dependencies: [CR-SWA-008]
steps:
  - Extend child task-runner processes to send a heartbeat message back to Spawn Manager every 30 seconds. If no heartbeat arrives after two intervals, mark the process as stalled and attempt graceful termination.
  - Log heartbeat status to a dedicated file so Security Scout can audit abnormal terminations. Provide a CLI option to adjust the heartbeat interval for performance testing.
  - Update the self-audit with lessons learned from monitoring to align with Section 22 stress test strategies.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Stalled processes are terminated within 1 minute during simulated failures.

category: Enhancement
effort: 2
owner_hint: Coordinator-Agent
dependencies: [CR-SWA-009]
steps:
  - Implement an environment variable `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` that bypasses data collection when set. Update documentation to explain why telemetry is useful and how users can opt out for privacy-sensitive scenarios.
  - Ensure that disabling telemetry does not affect core functionality or introduce errors in the dashboard aggregation script.
  - Include a runtime warning when telemetry is disabled so researchers are aware that metrics will be incomplete.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Setting `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` results in no telemetry files being written.
  - Other features operate normally with telemetry disabled.

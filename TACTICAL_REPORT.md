## 1. Agent Performance & System Health

| Metric                  | Value                               | Notes                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Ingestion Velocity**  | 3 prompts ingested  | Stable.                                   |
| **Security Events**     | 0 extraction failures | Low. Failures are primarily encoding errors. |
| **Deduplication Efficacy** | 0.00% flagged | Acceptable.                               |
| **Contributor Activity**| N/A                                 | No new contributor activity in the last two weeks.                    |

## 2. Strategic Reflections

1.  **Source Diversity:** The current ingestion pipeline is heavily reliant on GitHub. The addition of the HuggingFace crawler was a good first step, but we need to prioritize the implementation of the Discord and Reddit miners to increase source diversity.
2.  **Taxonomy Utilization:** The `llm_jailbreak.yaml` taxonomy is not yet being fully utilized. We need to integrate it into the prompt analysis pipeline to enable more granular filtering and reporting.
3.  **Effectiveness Benchmarking:** The lack of an automated effectiveness benchmark is a major gap. We need to prioritize the implementation of `CR-GOD-012` to close this loop.

## 3. Roadmap Pulse-Check

| Task ID      | Status      | Notes                               |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| CR-GOD-011   | **Blocked** | High-risk sources not yet identified. |
| CR-GOD-012   | **Pending** | Requires local LLM setup.           |
| CR-SWA-003   | **Blocked** | Client identification issues.       |

**Recommendation:** Re-prioritize CR-SWA-003 to unblock session-based rate limiting. Allocate resources to set up a local LLM for CR-GOD-012.

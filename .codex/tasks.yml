    title: Replace request ID rate limiting with session-based client tracking
    status: todo
    description: |
      `isRateLimited()` currently tracks tokens using the JSON-RPC request ID. This fails to
      enforce limits across multiple requests from the same client. Refactor the function to
      derive a stable identifier from session or clientInfo and add a TTL cleanup to avoid
      unbounded growth of the rateLimiter map.

    title: Ensure newline at end of all source files
    status: todo
    description: |
      Several `.js` files such as `spawn-manager.js`, `telemetry.js`, and many tests are missing
      a trailing newline. Add a lint rule or pre-commit check to enforce a single newline at the
      end of each file and update existing files accordingly.

    title: Consolidate test scripts under a single test runner
    status: todo
    description: |
      Tests are provided as standalone Node scripts and only `simple-test.js` is executed via
      `npm test`. Adopt a framework like Jest and migrate the existing scripts so all automated
      tests run with `npm test` and in CI.

    title: Document offline prompt workflow
    status: todo
    description: |
      The server supports an `--offline` mode to load prompts from the local `prompts/` directory
      but the README lacks detailed instructions. Document how to prepare local prompts, specify
      `CHUCKNORRIS_PROMPTS_DIR`, and verify prompt integrity.
